# Keep it or Dump it
A small quiz game I've been developing last summer. Based on this [video by Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lTrkC8LFMc). 
(This is merely a prototype. The current version only supports the category video games in German.) 

## Installation
Just download the folder, and open the following file:

KeepItOrDropIt\KeepItOrDropIt\bin\Debug\KeepItOrDropIt.exe

## How to play
When loading the game, twenty answers pertaining a specific category will be shown. At the bottom of the window will be displayed a prompt. With the buttons on each side of the screen you may decide whether you want to keep or dump all answers that fit said prompt. When you've clicked one of the buttons, all answers that fit or don't fir the prompt will be removed, and the next prompt appears. Your goal is to clear all prompts with at least one answer left on the board. 
You can restart the game by closing the window and reopening the file.
